Sitemaps, Hyper-lists and Beyond.


== Description ==

SiteTree is a lightweight solution to enhancing a WordPress website with a multi-page Site Tree, Google (Image) Sitemaps and News Sitemaps. Developed prioritising user-friendliness, SiteTree is plug-and-play and nearly independent from user input.


### An overview of the major features:

= A Family of Dynamic Sitemaps =

Be it a Site Tree, a collection of Google Sitemaps or a Google News Sitemap, the sitemap of your choice will always be up-to-date.

= SiteTree Dashboard =

Where you can control the activation of the sitemaps and the enabling of the automatic pinging functionality, choose which types of content to include, adjust the sitemap split-up threshold, reorder with a drag-and-drop the hyper-lists composing the Site Tree, and generally know details about the building process and the latest pinging events.

= Code-free Customisation =

WordPress-like settings pages together with the SiteTree Dashboard are where all your customisations take place. No need to be a developer to use SiteTree.

= A Myriad of Hyper-lists =

Fully documented and always ready-to-use, the `[sitetree]` shortcode and its workmate `sitetree_get_hyperlist()` are flexible like only a few other developer tools: you change one attribute, or argument, and a whole new, dynamic list of hyperlinks is all set to be perused.

= Custom Post Types Support =

You can include in the sitemaps any kind of content, custom or built-in. Yes, even in the Google News Sitemap.

= Exclude and Disallow =

Posts, Pages and Custom Posts can be excluded from the sitemaps and the shortcode-generated hyper-lists directly from the editor screen of WordPress. And with no more than a tick of a setting you can add to the 'robots.txt' file generated by WordPress a `Disallow` rule for each web page excluded from the Google Sitemap.

= Site Tree Pagination [NEW] =

The pagination of a medium-to-large Site Tree can really benefit usability, and SiteTree strives to make it happen: the plugin exactly knows when a hyper-list composing your Site Tree must be spread between multiple pages or can be left untouched, and it is equally punctual on choosing when a navigation menu must be showed up at the bottom of the multi-page Site Tree.

= XML Sitemap Index [NEW] =

An expanding website cannot welcome Googlebot but with a Sitemap Index: SiteTree creates a distinct sitemap, or a group of sitemaps, for each type of content the included permalinks belong to, and the best part is that SiteTree can silently switch between single and multiple sitemaps mode while keeping unchanged the location of the main sitemap.

= Automated and Upon-request Pinging =

SiteTree can ping Google both on request, and automatically whenever a permalink is added to a Google Sitemap or to a News Sitemap. And when the subject of the notification is a Google Sitemap, there is always a second ping ready to reach Bing.

= This is a Ghost Page =

When a page is flagged as Ghost Page, SiteTree automatically excludes the Page from all the sitemaps and the shortcode-generated hyper-lists, prevents the WP Super Cache plugin from caching the Page and hides the Page from crawlers without showing up its path in the 'robots.txt' file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Site Tree? =

It actually is a Site Map, a human-oriented listing marked up in HTML5 of the most prominent content of your website.

= Is there any chance of running into conflicts with the Core Sitemap functionality introduced in WordPress 5.5?

No, there isn't. The plugin automatically disables the Core Sitemap functionality when the Google Sitemap is active.

= Are the XML Sitemaps produced by SiteTree human-readable? =

Yes, they are. Although the Google Sitemaps and the Google News Sitemaps are crawler-oriented sitemaps, they are all equipped with an XSL Template that makes them human-readable.

= Can SiteTree generate Google Sitemaps complete with Change Frequency and Priority metadata? =

Starting from SiteTree 3.0 the plugin no longer has this ability, become obsolete by now.

= Will I lose my settings by upgrading from SiteTree 1.5.3? =

You will lose only your general settings, your preferences about whether or not to exclude a post or page from the sitemaps will be automatically upgraded. Instead, the Change Frequency and Priority metadata you might have set for some posts or pages will not require upgrade, because in the latest version of SiteTree their use has been dropped.


== Upgrade Notice ==

= 6.0.4 =

You might need to act on the 'Max. number of items' setting in the 'Site Tree Settings' screen to allow the plugin to show in the Site Tree the whole list of your Posts or Custom Posts.


== Changelog ==

= 6.0.4 (24 May 2021) =

Updated the informational message shown in the SiteTree Dashboard: now you will be told when SiteTree 7.0 is available.


= 6.0.3 (11 May 2021) =

[SiteTree is about to go premium.](https://luigicavalieri.com/blog/sitetree-goes-premium/)

Fixed:

* A PHP Fatal Error could arise on visiting the SiteTree Dashboard if one or more parent pages had been moved to the bin.
* When there was no News of type 'post' to show, but there were News filed under other Post Types included in the sitemap, SiteTree showed an empty News Sitemap.


= 6.0.2 (3 May 2021) =

Now you can tell SiteTree not to generate the 'Page' Google Sitemap by excluding the 'page' content type â€” you have to click on 'Configure' in the 'Google Sitemaps' pane.

Also, fixed a bug that caused non-existent Google Sitemaps to be served anyway as empty sitemaps.


= 6.0.1 (26 April 2021) =

Fixed a bug where a PHP notice could show up in the site's home page when a static home page was set.


= 6.0 (19 April 2021) =
*Requires WordPress 5.5 or later.*

Whether or not you were aware of the existence of Demux Leaf, the thrilling news now is that Demux Leaf is part of the core of SiteTree: Site Tree Pagination and XML Sitemap Index creation step into the feature-set!

A number of improvements and fixes are the corollary.


= 5.3.4 (29 March 2021) =

Updated the 'Leaves' page to reflect the recent renaming of Pro Leaf as Wonder Leaf. And, added uninstallation instructions in the `readme.txt` file.


= 5.3.3 (18 March 2021) =

Removed the donation links introduced with the previous update.


= 5.3.2 (15 March 2021) =

Added two links to the donate page on my website, one in the 'Plugins' screen, the other in the footer of the SiteTree Dashboard. The latter disappears as soon as you click on it.


= 5.3.1 (2 March 2021) =

Fixed an old bug that caused items in Custom Posts hyper-lists to show up with the wrong permalink.


= 5.3 (1 March 2021) =

Introduced 14 new hooks to let Multilingual Leaf, a newcomer among the Leaves family, intercommunicate with SiteTree.

Just an aside: if you own a multilingual website powered by WPML, have a look into [Multilingual Leaf](https://luigicavalieri.com/sitetree/leaves/multilingual/), you might find it useful!

Also, two main action hooks, `sitetree_will_build_lists` and `sitetree_did_build_lists`, triggered during the building process of the Site Tree, have been renamed respectively as `sitetree_will_build_site_tree` and `sitetree_did_build_site_tree`.

And like with any other release, bug fixes aren't missing. In particular, since SiteTree 5.0, a fatal error could fire off on loading the dynamic `robots.txt` file generated by WordPress.


= 5.2.1 (1 February 2021) =

Fixed a bug that caused the home page item in the hyper-list of Pages of your Site Tree to not be kept always at the top of the hyper-list.


= 5.2 (11 January 2021) =

It's time to introduce a Template Tag: `sitetree_get_hyperlist()` is only awaiting the developer inside you!


= 5.1.3 (2 January 2021) =

Fixed a critical bug introduced with SiteTree 5.1 that hindered the proper operation of the Google Sitemap.


= 5.1.2 (18 December 2020) =

Fixed a PHP Fatal Error that popped up when the hyper-list of Posts in the Site Tree was grouped by category and the group's title was hyperlinked.


= 5.1.1 (16 December 2020) =

Prepared the ground for Pro Leaf 1.1 and its Bulk Exclude functionality.

From this version on the fonts used by the XML Sitemaps' templates will be packaged in the plugin, so as to prevent that on server implementing stricter content policies the sitemaps have problems rendering in a browser.


= 5.1 (7 December 2020) =

The `[sitetree]` shortcode receives some love: through the new `only_children_of` attribute you can now tell SiteTree to generate hyper-lists of child pages.

Also, the Google Sitemap filename is finally customisable.


= 5.0 (24 November 2020) =
*Requires WordPress 5.3 or later.*

[The age of Leaves has begun](https://luigicavalieri.com/blog/introducing-leaves/): SiteTree opens up to the world of add-ons!

As well as with Extensibility, SiteTree steps further ahead thanks to the restyling and reorganisation of the administration area.

Also, this update marks another break with the past by finally removing from the database the Priority and Change Frequency metadata deprecated since version 3.0.


= 4.5.3 (20 November 2020) =

Fixed a bug where a fatal error could arise with plugins like Polylang that hook into the `user_has_cap` filter hook.


= 4.5.2 (9 November 2020) =

Raised to 1k the limit on the amount of items each list composing your Site Tree can contain.


= 4.5.1 (24 October 2020) =

Implemented a more reliable way of checking whether SiteTree is installed on a local development environment.


= 4.5 (19 October 2020) =

One shortcode, many lists: this update introduces the `[sitetree]` shortcode, sided by the ability to exclude Posts, Pages and Custom Posts from all the shortcode-generated lists directly from the editor screen.


= 4.4 (29 September 2020) =

As with the previous major update, Usability keeps being the main character: now the Automatic Pinging functionality for the Google Sitemap can be toggled on/off directly from the Pinging Bubble, in the dashboard.

And Flexibility follows along, with the introduction of two "de-hyperlinking" settings:

* the first pertains to the list of pages that might be present in your Site Tree, it lets you disable the hyperlinking of parent pages up to the third level.
* the second setting is such that when posts in the Site Tree are grouped by date, category or author, it lets you de-hyperlink the group's title.


= 4.3.2 (21 September 2020) =

Fixed a bug where, on grouping posts by date, category or author, the list included a spurious `<ul>` tag.


= 4.3.1 (7 September 2020) =

This patch fixes two critical bugs:

* The News Sitemap was accessible only if the Google Sitemap had also been activated.
* A flaw in the plugin's database abstraction layer could cause a series of PHP warnings.


= 4.3 (1 September 2020) =

SiteTree gains one point on user-friendliness! Now the lists making the Site Tree can be reordered with a drag-and-drop and without leaving the dashboard.   

Furthermore, a new setting comes in: this update adds the ability to choose how to order the list of pages that might be present in your Site Tree.


= 4.2 (13 August 2020) =

The XSL templates are now dynamically generated and fully localisable.

For WordPress 5.5 users: when the Google Sitemap is active the plugin automatically disables the Core Sitemap functionality introduced in the latest WordPress. 


= 4.1.2 (1 August 2020) =

Fixed a bug that caused the child pages listed in the Site Tree to have an incomplete permalink.


= 4.1.1 (6 July 2020) =

SiteTree has a new home on the web: [LuigiCavalieri.com](https://luigicavalieri.com/). Feel free to send me your feedback!


= 4.1 (15 June 2020) =

This update extends the pinging ability to the Google News Sitemap, and fixes a bug where the Pinging-On-Request wasn't available when all the automatic pings failed.


= 4.0.1 (1 June 2020) =

Fixed a bug that prevented the updating of the information related to the Google News Sitemap when the amount of listed news changed independently of the occurrence of a publishing event.


= 4.0 (25 May 2020) =

The plugin can now produce a third kind of sitemap, a News Sitemap! From which you can exclude content, if you need to, and in which you can include almost any WordPress Post Type, even more than one.

This update also drops the caching functionality, better suited to a dedicated plugin like WordPress Super Cache, which SiteTree natively supports.


= 3.2 (4 May 2020) =

Brought back the pinging facility! Renewed in behaviour and with more functionalities â€” like the pinging on request.

This update also fixes a bug where the plugin, in tallying the number of permalinks excluded from the Google Sitemap, took account of the binned posts that were flagged as excluded.


= 3.1 (20 April 2020) =

The Ghost Page functionality adds up to the feature-set!

A short intro: a page flagged as Ghost Page is automatically excluded from both sitemaps, not cached by the WP Super Cache plugin and hidden from crawlers without its path showing up in the 'robots.txt' file.


= 3.0.2 (7 April 2020) =

Fixed a major bug concerning the upgrade from SiteTree 1.5.3 and made general improvements.


= 3.0.1 (26 March 2020) =

Fixed:

* Custom taxonomies couldn't be included in the Google Sitemap.
* Authors' pages containing only custom posts couldn't be included in the Google Sitemap.
* Taxonomies containing only drafts were listed in the Site Tree.


= 3.0 (23 March 2020) =

In addition to the following this update adds support for custom post types and drops the use of the Change Frequency and Priority metadata, become obsolete by now. However, the metadata you have set for each post and page will not be deleted from the database during the upgrade.

Improvements:

* Content types can now be included directly from the dashboard.
* Now the content of the settings pages changes according to the type of content included in the sitemaps.
* Added in the dashboard a button to deactivate the Site Tree.
